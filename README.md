CSE-316-Project Question Assigned
You are a computer systems engineer working at a large technology company. Your manager has tasked you with creating a simulation program to test the performance of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm. The simulation program should generate a set of processes with random arrival times and CPU burst times, and should run the Round Robin algorithm for a set amount of time (e.g. 100 time units). The program should record the average waiting time and turnaround time for each process, and should compare the results with the ideal scenario of a perfect scheduler.
Solution Format Round Robin Scheduling algorithm in C Programming language
